Central to the Spring Framework is its inversion of control (IoC)
container, which provides a consistent means of configuring and managing
Java objects using reflection. The container is responsible for managing
object lifecycles of specific objects: creating these objects, calling
their initialization methods, and configuring these objects by wiring
them together.
